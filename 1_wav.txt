I have the pleasure to present to you. Dr. Martin Luther King.
 I am happy to John with you today.
 Are buffalo. Go down in history?
 As the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.
 Five, score years ago.
 A great American in whose symbolic Shadow We Stand today.
 Signed the Emancipation, Proclamation.
 This momentous decree came.
 As a great Beacon, Light Of Hope to millions of Niger.
